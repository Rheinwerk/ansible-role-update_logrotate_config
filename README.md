Configure Logrotate Jobs
=========


[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Rheinwerk/ansible-role-update_logrotate_config.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Rheinwerk/ansible-role-update_logrotate_config)

Requirements
------------

None.


Role Variables
--------------

There is one main variable that drives this role: `_logrotate`. It is a map that contains all configuration and settings for this role.
Please see `defaults/main.yml` for details.

Dependencies
------------

None.


Example Playbook
----------------

The general contract of this role is to take the variables map `_logrotate` from `defaults/main.yml` as a template for your configuration and pass that configuration as a parameter to this role.

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

    - hosts: servers
      var:
        LOGROTATE
          ...
      roles:
         - { role: update_logrotate_config, tags: [ 'update_logrotate_config' ], _logrotate: "{{ LOGROTATE }}" }
